# Random Movie Generator
This, as the name suggests, is a random movie generator! Press the "generate â˜†" button to generate a movie.
You are able to mark if you've watched a movie by pressing the corresponding button, and this prevents the movie from showing up again.
You are also able to hide a specific genre of movies, by pressing the "don't recommend" button.
